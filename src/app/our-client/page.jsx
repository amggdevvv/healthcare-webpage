              “100% of my cases are Plaintiffs’ personal injury. I use Trial
              Template 100% of the time and would not think of approaching
              mediation, an MSC or trial without Trial Template. It enables me
              to convert lower value cases into mid-range value cases, and turns
              mid-range cases into significant cases. This is a boon to my firm
              and my clients and it is not just for trial. They showed me how to
              turn cases into Trial Template presentations that I can create
              myself and then export them into movies. That really move the
              needle with adjusters and decision makers.
              <br />
              <br />
              Trial Template is such an effective tool that I now view evidence
              in terms of how I can present it. Whether it is the great quote
              from a deposition or a smoking gun email, I know that it will make
              it more powerful. This product adds value to every one of my cases
              and is a blast to work with.”
